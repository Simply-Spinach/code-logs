	<h1> Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags </h1>
    <p> Semantic Tags are tags in html that describe what the object is beyond
        just a functional perspective.  For example, take a header, defined with
        &lth1&gh.  There is very little defined as to what a &quotheader&quot exactly is.
        Is it the title of a book, is it the beginning of a chapter or is it the
        name of a website?  Without a human reading what&aposs inside the header, it&aposs
        very hard to tell what exactly this header is.  While that may not matter
        as much to the average browsing experience, there are certainly users who
        do care about these intricacies.  Accessibility tools like text to speech
        will interact with these elements better as long as they are defined, for
        example, and even non-human &quotusers&quot, website scrapers, are important to
        accommodate as Google&aposs scrapers will use semantic elements to determine 
        what's important for them from your website and what is not important to
        them.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Some examples of semantic tags are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                &ltarticle&gt: A section that can be taken "out of context" of it's orgin and still understood.
            </li>
            <li> 
                &ltheader&gt: Where the primary header is of a document.
            </li>
            <li>
                &lttitle&gt: Title of a document
            </li>
            <li>
                &ltnav&gt: Navigation elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                &ltaside&gt: Content in a side bar
            </li>
            <li>
                &ltsection&gt: A generalized grouping element
            </li>
        </ul>
        And many more...
