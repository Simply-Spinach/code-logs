	<h1> Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags </h1>
    <p> Semantic Tags are tags in html that describe what the object is beyond just a functional perspective.
        For example, take a paragraph, defined with <code><p></code> and <code></p></code>.  There is very little defined as to what a
        paragraph is.  Is it able to be taken out of context?  Is this here just to insert a new line?  When thinking about different ways
        a browser can read data that is important for the user.  Accessability tools like text to speech will interact with these elements better 
        as long as they are defined and website scrapers like google's algorithms to put your website on their map will use semantic elements to determine
        what's important for them from your website and what is not
    </p>
    <p> 
        Some examples of semantic tags are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                &ltarticle&gt: A section that can be taken "out of context" of it's orgin and still understood
            </li>
            <li> 
                &ltheader&gt: Where the primary header is of a document
            </li>
            <li>
                &ltnav&gt: Navigation elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                &ltaside&gt: Content in a side bar
            </li>
            <li>
                &ltsection&gt: A generalized grouping element
            </li>
        </ul>
        And many more...
